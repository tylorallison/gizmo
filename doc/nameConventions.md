# Gizmo Naming Conventions

## Class properties

* "Protected" properties/methods start with _.  These should not be accessed outside of the classes/subclasses that define them.
    example: *foo*._data
* "Special" properties/methods start with $.  Special rules apply for how they can be referenced.
